You’re thinking like a product designer! Here’s an honest roadmap and practical advice, with fast results **now** and flexibility for the future.

## 🚦 **Your Immediate Pipeline**

1. **Run your import pipeline again** (now fully working!)

   * Use your latest JSON with all available sources (Google Books, Open Library, etc.).
   * You can keep re-importing as your book list grows or sources improve.

---

## 🖼️ **Building a Book List Viewer**

### **Option 1: Django Admin or Browsable API**

* **Fastest:**

  * Admin UI is always available (but not pretty for sharing).
  * Browsable API is simple for devs.

---

### **Option 2: Django Template-Based Public Page**

* **Simplicity:**

  * Add a Django view and template to display your books (`/books/`).
  * Can render any query, filter, or per-user view.
* **Pros:**

  * No frontend framework needed.
  * “Works anywhere Django does.”
* **Cons:**

  * Not easily embeddable in non-Django sites.

---

### **Option 3: React (or Vanilla JS) Widget**

* **Most Flexible and Embeddable:**

  * Write a small React component (or Vanilla JS “widget”) that fetches from your API and displays the list.
  * Can be embedded via `<script>` tag or React NPM package.
* **Pros:**

  * Can be dropped into any site (yours, friends’, author sites, etc.).
  * Looks and feels modern.
* **Cons:**

  * Slightly more work, but pays off in flexibility.

---

### **Option 4: “Static” Export Widget**

* **If you want a zero-setup embeddable option:**

  * Export your book list as a self-contained HTML/JS “card” you can paste anywhere.
  * (Good for newsletters, static blogs, etc.)

---

## 🥇 **My Strong Recommendation**

* **Short-term:**

  * Add a **Django view/template** (`/books/`) to make your list public, beautiful, and easy to browse.
* **Mid-term:**

  * Build a **React widget** that fetches from your API.
  * You or anyone else can embed it on any site.

---

## **Sample Flow**

**A. Django view for “What I’m Reading”**

* Add this to your URLs:

  ```python
  path("books/", weread.views.BookListView.as_view(), name="public-books"),
  ```
* Render with a template (`books.html`), list covers, titles, authors, etc.

**B. Widget**

* Build a React (or vanilla JS) widget:

  * Fetches from your `/api/books/`
  * Displays a nice “What I’m Reading” panel.
  * Embed on any page with a single line.

**C. (Optional) Settings**

* Show “What I’m Reading” or “What We’re Reading” (toggle by user/group/public).

## **Next Step: What Do You Want?**

* **Ready-to-go Django template view?**
* **React widget starter?**
* **Vanilla JS embed for static sites/newsletters?**
* **All of the above (step by step)?**

**Let me know your top priority, and I’ll code the first version for you!**
